			<span class="-credit-info">There are several Tasks that are repeated throughout the module.  So you can accomplish a certain Task more than one way:</span><br />
			<pre>
				Add A new Folder:
                                1) Click the "Star with a plus sign" from the Favorites Toolbar.
				   - a default bookmark folder is created,
				   - then the Bookmark Title should be ready for editing in approx. 5 secs.
				   - automatically.  No URL will be saved, so this is only a folder for bookmarks.

				2) Type a new Title into the 1st Text Editor Field in Topmost Toolbar,
				   - then fill in the next text editor box, with the Url value,
				   - next click the "green arrow" following the url text box.
				   - onClick a new bookmark will be automatically saved to the database,
				   - then a new Tab will be created showing your new Bookmark results.

				   - From the Nav Panel, the one with the Bookmark Tree inside it,
				   - Click the bottom-most Accordion Title Bar (Add New Favorite).
				   - onClick, a form panel is created to enter a new bookmark this way.

				4) Final option to this point:
				   - From the Nav Panel, the one with the  Bookmark Tree inside it,
