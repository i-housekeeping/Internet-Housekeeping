<br>
<p style="padding-left: 35px;">
		&nbsp;Internet Housekeeping web project comes with a simple goal to automate repeatable activities performed in our everyday life. The idea was to analyze the way how we utilize money assets, manage simple everyday tasks and handle the knowledge base resources. After detailed review we conclude, that all mentioned activities could be united and presented in one solid environment, which will connect and present them in a new form. We called a new presentation – “Modern Housekeeping” taken place in internet cloud. Registered users will be pleasured with the adorable environment, which present recording and automating routine everyday activities in a form of Blog article or short story including the links to knowledge resources, action items and money spreadsheet. The next thing we think about was an option to share these stories with other people, like recommendations or advice receipt. This new form of activities presentation is available for experts review and corrections whenever it required.
		<br /><br />&nbsp;We decide to call our initiative as “Internet Housekeeping” and implement it as a web-based app available to everyone. We choose a web desktop as a form to present the information to users, since we think that this form of presentation is familiar to everyone and very similar to what we have at personal computers. We try to simulate basic features from regular desktop and present the basic services as a stand alone application like we have in on our home PC. We call the global service as a “Webtop” meaning the union of two words web and desktop. Webtop is handling only operations (like time management, money utilization and knowledgebase resources) over the user’s personal data. 
		<br /><br />&nbsp;Going further, we think about how the user’s personal data will be managed. The main constrain was not to expose it to everyone and to store it on the end user place. We are completely sure; such approach will guarantee the security and privacy of the personal data (money transactions, lists of personal activities and private knowledgebase resources. We think that personal information, which includes the money assets, could be treated as a bequest, later on and could be passed to relative in specific cases. We build a simple mechanism including the option to compress and encrypt the private information. This information could be backed up at our servers, with no option to review the content. We also prepare an option to share the personal info with experts like CPA or personal coachers under the different levels of data resolution (all or a couple of records). 
		<br /><br />&nbsp;We eager to see you as our customer and have a big fun with our product, since we believe that “Internet Housekeeping” can definitely save your time and open new horizons happy and measured life.
